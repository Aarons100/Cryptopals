Set 3:
	Chall 17 - Firm understanding of attack, can guess first character, full implementation of algorithm didn't seem necessary
	Chall 18 - Done
	Chall 19 - Have firm understanding, implementing attack (Frequency analysis) didnt seem necessary
	Chall 20 - 
	Chall 21 - Done
	Chall 22 - Done, but the attack requires quite a few minutes and I felt like moving on
	Chall 23 - Done, didn't want to destroy my MT19937 class to actually clone my own twister though

	Chall 31 - Done
	Chall 32 - Same attack as chall 31, but more precise timing, so I omitted this challenge
